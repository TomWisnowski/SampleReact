## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (Node package manager)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```

   ```
3. Install the dependencies:

### Running the Application
To start the development server, run:
```
npm start
```
This will open the application in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Building for Production
